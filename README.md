### I release the stress **of developing software for small companies**

Working with an independent developer may be stressful. If you're running a small business, you're already under a lot of stress. Now you are dealing with withdrawing a software project with a programmer you hardly know. Besides trusting the developer has the technical chops to do the job, you hope that your choice will worry at least half of your business as you do.

Great news: the right developer can eliminate stress. I intend to be just that developer, a technological partner who unlocks the power of software to help your business thrive.

Here's what clients have said about my beautiful work:

“Jamal is very honest. Jamal did an amazing job and was able to fix the things the past developers said they had done, but didn’t do it correctly.”

“Excellent Developer and very talented, I recommend him to everyone who wants to make a successful project.”

“Great Job Mr. Jamal it was done perfectly!”

“Very professional, clean code, and did everything in a very timely manner, wouldn't hesitate to hire him again if more work came my way.”

When you think of a new business, what do you think of first? If you’re like most people, you might think of the products or services your business will offer. However, there are many more things to consider before launching your new business and developing a website. You need to create a website that not only looks great but, also conveys the right message about your business and drives traffic back to it. Moreover, it has to be mobile-friendly because Google recently announced it will now rank websites based on their mobile-friendliness. So if you have an existing business, then redesigning your website is even more important than creating one from scratch.

There are some of the major considerations in developing a website, first what is your mission, and purpose, and what value you will add to your clients? The second is the development side, which lies first in the design, for the most part, I do a deep search to find the best, unique and modern design that gets the attention of the user and converts them to a real client. After I do a benchmarking between technologies to find the best choice of programming languages, servers, and databases to make it live.

More than that, I strive to make the complexities of technology less intimidating. You realize that you need software, but the intricacies of technology can be intimidating, especially if you're unfamiliar with terms like ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, JavaScript, SQL, or APIs. The software industry appears to grow more complicated by the day. How can you stay informed and trust your developer is making the right choices? The answer is simple: experience and judgment.

Every project requires unique technology and compromises. I've developed everything from a simple and static landing page to more complex applications like those that detect faces in photos. Having the ability to make informed decisions about those choices comes from experience. Whether you are comfortable with technology or not, I can assist you in understanding software options. I will assist you in making decisions that benefit your business!

Why don't we talk about what you're up to? There is no need to sit on your thoughts about that new system or ways to automate that annoying manual process. I would like to learn more about your business and what I can do to help you. If I don't believe I'm the ideal person for the job, I will be straightforward about it. If we work together, you'll get a technology partner with a strong commitment to helping you reach your business objective. It would be my pleasure to explore what you and I can do for your business! Please get in touch and we can schedule a time to discuss your project.

Last but not least, It's fortunate that my services and experience are in high demand. Because of this, I receive job interview requests every week. I try to reply to each one personally. However, I cannot always do so, especially for standard requests that do not provide sufficient information. Please be as detailed as you can when requesting my services so that I may better gauge how well I will fit your needs.

It's always nice to get in touch with people to build a relationship, even if a project doesn't immediately seem like a good fit for me, I still like to respond in the hope of establishing a connection. If you are open to scheduling, I can often fit your project onto my schedule. I prioritize projects that will have a significant impact on a small business.

I strive for excellence, and I only accept jobs I know I can handle. Excellence in quality is my top priority. I finish everything on time, every time. Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon!
